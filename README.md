Advanced Encryption Tool

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a robust Python-based application designed to ensure data security through file encryption and decryption using advanced algorithms like AES-256. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to generate encryption keys, encrypt files, and decrypt them securely.

Key Features:
AES-256 Encryption: Uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key, offering strong protection.
Key Generation: Automatically generates a secure key for encryption, which is stored safely for future use.
Encryption and Decryption: Allows users to select any file and securely encrypt it. The tool can also decrypt files using the previously generated key.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear prompts and messages to guide users through the encryption and decryption process.
Secure Key Management: Ensures that the encryption key is unique and properly stored to prevent unauthorized access.
Usage Scenarios:
Data Protection: Safeguard confidential files by encrypting them before sharing.
Data Integrity: Protect sensitive documents from unauthorized access.
Secure File Transfer: Encrypt files before transmitting over untrusted networks.
This tool is ideal for individuals and organizations looking to enhance file security and protect sensitive information from cyber threats.
